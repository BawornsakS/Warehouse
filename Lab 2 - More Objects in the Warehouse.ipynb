    "## Part 1: Create a new class on your own\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will create a new class, and then we will use this class in the warehouse. The new class we are implementing is Product class. It will represent a product in a warehouse. Now, observe the Warehouse class, and create a Product class with this specification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Name of the class: ```Product```\n",
    "2. The constructor has 3 arguments: a product name, created date, expiration date\n",
    "3. A function called ```isExpired()``` which takes a date as an input and output True if the product is expired, and False otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Integrating with the Warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to Lab 1 Exercise 1, instead of adding a string into the warehouse, add all of them as a product object. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Get rid of some trashes\n",
    "Now, you will implement a function in Warehouse class called \n",
    "```python\n",
    "getRidOfTrashes() \n",
    "```\n",
    "which takes 1 argument called ```date```. The warehouse should remove every expired product from the warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "ps. Expired product is a product which, ```date``` passed ```expiration date``` of the product."
